        Modern Dream Foundation is a non-profit trust dedicated to building a
        healthier, happier, and more sustainable society. We believe that true
        transformation begins with the well-being of individuals—physically,
        mentally, and emotionally—and extends to the empowerment of entire
        communities.

      <p className="text-sm md:text-base xl:text-lg text-gray-600 mt-5">
        Our work focuses on raising awareness around lifestyle-related health
        issues, promoting emotional and mental well-being, encouraging
        sustainable and organic living, and creating opportunities for
        education, skill development, and livelihood—especially for women,
        youth, and underrepresented groups.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-base xl:text-lg text-gray-600 mt-5">
        Through innovative programs, community outreach, educational workshops,
        and cultural initiatives, we strive to reconnect people with nature,
        nurture inner resilience, and support people in making healthier, more
        conscious life choices.
